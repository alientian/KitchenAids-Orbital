# KitchenAids-Orbital
Proposed Level of Achievement:
Project Apollo

Motivation:
We occasionally forgot about food kept in the kitchen. Many of us may have faced the issue of throwing away expired food that was never opened. Not only is it a waste of money, but these will also contribute to food wastage. Reducing food wastage is important given that there is food shortage around the world. 

We often lose track of the food supplies in our house, and by the time we know it, some of the food has already expired. Besides that, many may have encountered the problem of running out of ideas to cook with the items in the fridge, especially for those who cook very often. Hence, it would definitely be nice to have a record where we could organize all the food and also provide us with recommendations of what to cook with the food supplies we have.

Aim:
We hope to make the kitchen more well organised and reduce food wastage through the creation of a kitchen aid application.
The iOS app, KitchenAids, provides a planner for users to keep track of their food supplies in the kitchen.

Features 
1. Create a list to record groceries bought
- Add items to the list
- Display expiring products in the kitchen and warn users about it 

2. Recommend recipes to cook with existing supplies

3. Recommend recipes that are healthy and fulfill daily nutritional needs
- Create data visualization on the app interface
